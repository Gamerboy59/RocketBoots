# Can players disable RocketBoots for themselves? (/rocketboots off|on)
# This is useful if you have a survival/PvP server where players wear boots
# for protection, and not just RocketBoots
playersCanDisable: true

# With this enabled, RocketBoots will stop the server from kicking you
# for flying when flight is disabled on the server.
#
# This is very hacky, and *the server will flood your console with warnings*
# like "[WARNING] Player was kicked for floating too long" as RocketBoots
# prevents each kick. This is unavoidable, but it's the only way to let you fly
# with "allow-flight=false". Also, while preventing this flood of kicks,
# flying will become laggy and slow for everyone with the gold and chainmail boots
#
# If you are sure you want to enable this hack (and realise that it'll make the boots
# less smooth), set this to true ;)
